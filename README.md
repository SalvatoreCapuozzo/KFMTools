# KFM Tools
## Introduction
Kubic FLOTAC Microscope system requires data collection and analysis in order to obtain better results.
For this reason, KFM Tools have been developed. These are the functionalities provided by this toolkit:
- Images Labeler: Label the images in a folder and save labels with YOLOv8 format
- Camera Viewer: Concat images from scan session in order to have the chamber image
- Results Analyzer: Get evaluation metrics by comparing results obtained with AI model with observations

The toolkit work on folders with an “images” folder containing all the images from a scan process. The “labels” folder will be generated by the toolkit in order to store bounding box labels. If the folder already contains a “labels” folder with .txt files, the toolkit will put all the existing labels on the currently reading image. It is possible to move from an image to another one smoothly with the dedicated buttons or shortcuts.
